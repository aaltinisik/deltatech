-  Features:

   -  Can create simple production, with configurable components and
      resulting products, without having to create a list of materials
   -  Creates two stock pickings, with configurable picking type. The
      pickings can be accessed from the simple production screen, and
      can be validated automatically or manually
   -  The stock price for the resulting product(s) is computed from the
      stock price of the components. If multiple products are in the
      result, the price must be entered manually. If price of the result
      product is 0, an error is thrown (can be overrided by setting the
      "simple_production_allow_zero_cost" system parameter to a no-zero
      value).
   -  A new product and a new sale order can be created automatically
      for the resulting product (the user must be in the " Sale simple
      production" group). The sale price of the resulting product is
      computed from the sale price of the components
