-  This module:

   -  adds the field "code" in the Time Off Type form
   -  in the employee menu in list view you can select employees then
      press "Action" -> "Export Working Days" to make an Excel file that
      contains the employees with their hours worked per day number of
      hours worked in total , the number of meal vouchers earn by the
      employee and see the days they were on time off
   -  if the code field in Time Off Type form is empty the cell will
      have "ABS" instead of the type of time off code
